    | Font fallback
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | What happens when the family a document resolved cannot draw one of its
    | characters. A font-family list resolves to ONE family and stops, which is
    | what the property means, but the family that wins is not necessarily one
    | that covers the text: 'Arial' resolves to the standard Helvetica, which is
    | written with WinAnsi and has no slot for Polish, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew
    | or Arabic. Without a fallback those print as question marks.
    |
    | So the fallback happens per CHARACTER. The family a document asked for
    | still draws everything it can, and only the characters it cannot are
    | looked for in the bundled DejaVu Sans, which carries Latin, Greek,
    | Cyrillic, Hebrew and Arabic. A document whose own faces cover its text
    | never reaches it and is written byte for byte as it was.
    |
    | The bundled faces live in the package's own resources/fonts and carry
    | their licence beside them. Nothing is ever fetched.
    |
    |   enabled  Off restores the older behaviour: an unavailable character is
    |            painted as '?' on a standard face and as an empty box on an
    |            embedded one.
    |   strict   Refuse the render when a font-family list resolves to no
    |            registered face at all, or a character no face can draw reaches
    |            a page. Off by default, because a font-family list is written
    |            so that entries CAN miss. What misses is always available from
    |            ->fontReport() whether this is on or not.

    | procurement portal asks for when it says "PDF/A".
    |
    | What it adds: every font embedded, an sRGB profile saying what the
    | document's colors mean, an XMP metadata stream declaring the conformance
    | so an archive can check the claim without opening the pages, and a file
    | identifier. It also turns tagging on, since an archival document should
    | say what its ink means as well as where it went; call ->tagged(false)
    | after ->pdfa() for a conforming file without the structure tree.
    |
    | Two things it refuses rather than quietly dropping, because writing
    | anything at all would be writing a claim that is not true:
    |
    |   A document that reaches one of the 14 standard faces (Helvetica, Times,
    |   Courier) has no font file to embed, since this package has the metrics
    |   for those and not the outlines. Register a TrueType family under
    |   'fonts' above and give the document a font-family that names it.
    |
    |   PDF/A forbids encryption in every part and at every level, so this and
    |   'encryption' cannot both be on for one document.

    | Both throw FlexPDF\Engine\Exceptions\PdfaConformanceException.

    | 'conformance' is the level the file claims, 'B' or 'A'. Level B says the
    | document will be drawn the same way forever; level A says its structure is
    | meaningful as well, so a reader can take it apart and read it out loud.
    | 'ua' claims ISO 14289-1, PDF/UA-1, beside it, which is the accessibility
    | standard a public body usually means when it asks for an accessible PDF.
    |
    | Both are promises rather than settings, and both are refused when the
    | document cannot back them: each needs the structure tree and a language,
    | so set 'tagged.enabled' and 'tagged.lang' with them, or give the markup
    | an <html lang> attribute.

    |   max_depth        Recursion ceiling for pathologically nested boxes.
    |   max_length       Largest resolved CSS length, in points. Absurd
    |                    lengths produce flows that cannot be paginated.
    |   max_font_size    Largest font-size honored, in points. Past this a
    |                    single line box exceeds any page.
    |   timeout_seconds  Wall-clock budget for one render, checked at the loop

    |                    A tiled repeating gradient asks for thousands per
